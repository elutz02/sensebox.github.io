"Through the first first support of the Federal Ministry of Education and Research as part of the Make Light Initiative the senseBox:home and senseBox:edu were further developed as a class set. In addition, it was possible to distribute 100 senseBox:home, to set up a measuring network, and distribute 100 senseBox:edu to student laboratories throughout Germany. Futhermore, it was made possible to develop a coorporate design and this website."
