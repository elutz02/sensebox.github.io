"The University of Münster has developed senseBox, a do-it-yourself kit for stationary and mobile sensor stations – a Citizen Science Toolkit. Citizens with senseBox:home can use the technology for their own local research, to collect environmental data, or to contribute to the openSenseMap sensor network, a platform of open sensor data running on AWS. Currently, over 1 billion measurements are ready for download and analysis. senseBox:edu provides schools and junior scientists with an experimental box with didactical concepts, instructions, and project ideas to help users build and code their own environmental measurement station on the Internet of Things-enabled platform."
