description: "<p><em>Blockly for senseBox</em> is a visual programming interface to offer a fast and easy access working with the senseBox. Blockly was developed by <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/blockly/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\"> Google</a> and one can find a lot of different visual programming interfaces based on this system. Thanks to the work of <a href=\"https://github.com/carlosperate\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\"> carlosperate</a> the Arduino can now programmed via a visual interface. We added blocks for our specific senseBox sensors and other component to make it even more easier to learn programming and measuring the enviroment.</p>"
description_installieren: "<p><em>Blockly for senseBox</em> runs online and without any installation in your browser. The code will be compiled online and can be copied to your senseBox MCU like copying a file to USB Drive </p> <p> If you use the senseBox:edu Version 1 or any other Arduino Microcontroller for transmitting the created sketch you still need the Arduino IDE and the senseBox library. You can find a installation guideline in our <a href=\"https://edu.books.sensebox.de/en/getting_started/software_installation.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\"> Books</a>. </p>"
