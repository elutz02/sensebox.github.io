blockly-head: "Blockly for senseBox"
blockly-text: "With Blockly for senseBox you can program your senseBox MCU via a graphical programming interface. No software has to be installed on the computer and you can start right away. There is an app for tablets, so that the senseBox can also be programmed wirelessly via a tablet."

arduino-text: "You can download the Arduino IDE for free at <a href=\"https://arduino.cc/downloads\">arduino.cc</a>. The Arduino IDE gives you complete access to all the features of the Arduino programming language. You can also use the Arduino IDE to program additional sensors and devices that are not included in Blockly for senseBox or openRoberta. The Arduino IDE must be installed on the computer and additionally a Board Support Package for the senseBox MCU must be installed. How exactly this works you can find out <a href=\"/documentation/en/arduino_ide.html\">here</a>"
