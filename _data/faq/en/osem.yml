- q: Is it possible to register other devices than senseBoxes on openSenseMap?
  a: Of course! The only requirement is that the device speaks HTTP to submit its sensor data to openSenseMap. You can find everything you need in our [API-Docs](https://docs.opensensemap.org/).


- q: How is the data stored in the openSenseMap licensed?

    We wouldn't mind hearing from you and your data use case though.
