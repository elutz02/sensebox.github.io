- q: Is it possible to add additional sensors to my senseBox:home?
  a: >
    Definitely! The senseBox:home is based on the Arduino platform, so every Arduino-compatible sensor can be added to your senseBox:home.
    You just need to modify your sketch and then [add the new sensor](https://osem.books.sensebox.de/en/osem_edit.html) to your senseBox on the openSenseMap.
- q: Where can I get the casing for the temperature sensor?
  a: >
    You can download the files for the temperature sensor casing [here](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1523429). It can be printed on every off-the-shelf 3D printer available.
- q: Can I operate the senseBox:home with a 9V battery?
  a: >
    It's possible to power the senseBox:home with a 9V battery, but we advise against it. The capacity of such batteries are too low to keep the senseBox:home running over a reasonable time.
- q: The sensor test is not working. What can I do?
  a: >
    Please remove all sensors from your arduino and reconnect them piece by piece between restarts. By using this approach, you can determine which sensor is causing the problems.
